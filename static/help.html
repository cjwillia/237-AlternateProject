			This is a block: <img src="/static/images/redblock.gif">
			<br />
			<p>Blocks fall from the sky, and are worth points in this game. When they get cleared, they give you points. The default value of a block is one point. When a block touches another block of the same color, it gains point value. The goal of this game, like most games, is to get lots and lots of points. It follows that you want to manipulate like-colored blocks to be next to each other, but I won't tell you what to do.</p>
			<br />
			This is a clearer: <img src="/static/images/greenclearer.gif">
			<br />
			<p>Clearers are blocks, sort of. They fall from the sky and have color. Visually, they're blocks with X's in them. The main difference is that when a clearer is next to a block of the same color, it will clear itself, that block, and any like-colored blocks touching those blocks in a chain, adding all of the point values of the blocks in the chain to your score! As far as points go, clearers are worth the same as blocks, so factor that into your decision-making.</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			<p>In this example, all of the red blocks shown would be cleared, because they're all connected in a chain, and there's a red clearer in that chain (which would get cleared, too.) The green clearer wouldn't clear anything because it doesn't have any friends. :c</p>

			<p>The game ends either when the timer at the top of the screen reaches 0, or when your blocks are piled up to where those sad orange squares are. If ever a piece is all the way up to there, the game will end.</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<p>Now get out there and stack some blocks up.</p>
